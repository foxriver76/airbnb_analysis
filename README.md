## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using the AirBnb data of Boston and Seattle to better understand:

1. At which time are the AirBnbs most busy?
2. Is the price higher in busy months?
3. Does a more expensive AirBnb lead to better reviews?

Datasets are available in this repository in the `data` folder.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The `analyze` notebook is, the only file needed. The data is read inside the notebook and analysis of all 3 questions is done in there. 

## Results<a name="results"></a>
You can find the results on [IoT Blog](https://iot-blog.net)


## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The dataset is obtained from Kaggle [Boston](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/boston) and [Seattle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle). Thanks to AirBnb for providing the data.
